Reproducibility data package
----------------------------

This directory contains four different directories that reproduce the
data for the article: 

- To be able to run the scripts the user needs:

1. Install PyGBe. 

Installation can be done via docker or from source. Dockerfile and instructions for source installation are available in the Github code repository https://github.com/barbagroup/pygbe

2. Download input problem folders data from zenodo

Download zip file and extract in desired location. If using docker container, data should be available in the container.

Important note:
When passing input problem folder path to run scripts the path must end in /:

For example: if input_problem_folders was downloaded in the directory 

home/Downloads, then the path will be:

home/Downloads/input_problem_folders/


- Directories content description.

Name of directory: repro_dielectrics_data


subdirectory noteboooks_analysis_and_diel_generation:

- Contains three Jupyter notebooks with the analysis of the dielectrics data from the papers that were extracted. These notebooks allowed us to decide the interpolation strategy used to generate the data we needed. 

Notebooks: - water_data_analysis.ipynb
           - silver_data_analysis.ipynb
           - bsa_data_analysis.ipynb

- Contains a Jupyter notebook and a bash script that can both be used to generate the dielectric data used in our computations.

The user can either run the bash script:

$ bash generate_dielectric_data.sh

or open the generate_dielectric_data.ipynb notebook and press run all.

Either option the results will be saved under the directory:

repro_dielectrics_data/dielectrics_data_results/

The original results used in our simulations are under:

repro_dielectrics_data/dielectrics_data_results/original

Note: We use experimental data from Johnson and Christy, 1972 (silver) and Hale and Querry, 1972 (water) to perform the interpolation. These data is located under the directory silver_water_raw_data. 


Name of directory: repro_BSA_silver_NP_LSPR_response_data

This folder contains the necessary scripts to reproduce all the
results related to sensitivity calculations. 

* dielectrics_data/

This subdirectory contains the dielectric data needed to perform the computations. The reproducible package associated with how this data was obtained can be found in repro_dielectrics_data directory.

* Cext_two_bsa_x_results/original 

This subdirectory contains the original results of the LSPR response
of the Silver nanoparticle with no proteins and with the presence of
two BSA at a distance of 1 nm at each side of the x-axis. It also contains a txt file reporting the run-time for the problem (all times are in seconds) 

To replicate this result the user should be inside the directory scripts and run the following shell command:

$ python Cext_wave_dist_prot_sensor_x.py -if full_path_where_input_problem_folder_is_located

In an Nvidia K40c GPU card the run-time is approximately 6 hours.

After running the script the user results can be found in the directory

Cext_two_bsa_x_results/


* Cext_two_bsa_y_results/original 

This subdirectory contains the original results of the LSPR response
of the Silver nanoparticle with no proteins and with the presence of
two BSA at a distance of 1 nm at each side of the y-axis. It also contains a txt file reporting the run-time for the problem (all times are in seconds) 

To replicate this result the user should be inside the directory scripts and run the following shell command:

$ python Cext_wave_dist_prot_sensor_y.py -if full_path_where_input_problem_folder_is_located

In an Nvidia K40c GPU card the run-time is approximately 5.2 hours.

After running the script the user results can be found in the directory

Cext_two_bsa_y_results/


* Cext_variation_with_distance_two_bsa_z_results/original 

This subdirectory contains the original results of the LSPR response
of the Silver nanoparticle with no proteins and with the presence of
two BSA at a distances of 0.5 nm, 1 nm, and 2 nm at each side of the y-axis. It also contains a txt file reporting the run-time for the problem (all times are in seconds) 

To replicate this result the user should be inside the directory scripts and run the following shell command:

$ python Cext_wave_dist_prot_sensor_z.py -if full_path_where_input_problem_folder_is_located

In an Nvidia K40c GPU card the run-time is approximately 16 hours.

After running the script the user results can be found in the directory

Cext_variation_with_distance_two_bsa_z_results/
