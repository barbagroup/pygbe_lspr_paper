Reproducibility data package
----------------------------

This directory contains four different directories that reproduce the
data for the article: 

- To be able to run the scripts the user needs:

1. Install PyGBe. 

Installation can be done via docker or from source. Dockerfile and instructions for source installation are available in the Github code repository https://github.com/barbagroup/pygbe

2. Download input problem folders data from zenodo

Download zip file and extract in desired location. If using docker container, data should be available in the container.

Important note:
When passing input problem folder path to run scripts the path must end in /:

For example: if input_problem_folders was downloaded in the directory 

home/Downloads, then the path will be:

home/Downloads/input_problem_folders/


- Directories content description.

Name of directory: repro_dielectrics_data

This 




Name of directory: repro_BSA_silver_NP_LSPR_response_data

This folder contains the necessary scripts to reproduce all the
results related to sensitivity calculations. 

* dielectrics_data/

This subdirectory contains the dielectric data needed to perform the computations. The reproducible package associated with how this data was obtained can be found in repro_dielectrics_data directory.

* Cext_two_bsa_x_results/original 

This subdirectory contains the original results of the LSPR response
of the Silver nanoparticle with no proteins and with the presence of
two BSA at a distance of 1 nm at each side of the x-axis. It also contains a txt file reporting the run-time for the problem (all times are in seconds) 

To replicate this result the user should be inside the directory scripts and run the following shell command:

python Cext_wave_dist_prot_sensor_x.py -if full_path_where_input_problem_folder_is_located

In an Nvidia K40c GPU card the run-time is approximately 6 hours.

After running the script the user results can be found in the directory

Cext_two_bsa_x_results/


* Cext_two_bsa_y_results/original 

This subdirectory contains the original results of the LSPR response
of the Silver nanoparticle with no proteins and with the presence of
two BSA at a distance of 1 nm at each side of the y-axis. It also contains a txt file reporting the run-time for the problem (all times are in seconds) 

To replicate this result the user should be inside the directory scripts and run the following shell command:

python Cext_wave_dist_prot_sensor_y.py -if full_path_where_input_problem_folder_is_located

In an Nvidia K40c GPU card the run-time is approximately 5.2 hours.

After running the script the user results can be found in the directory

Cext_two_bsa_y_results/


* Cext_variation_with_distance_two_bsa_z_results/original 

This subdirectory contains the original results of the LSPR response
of the Silver nanoparticle with no proteins and with the presence of
two BSA at a distances of 0.5 nm, 1 nm, and 2 nm at each side of the y-axis. It also contains a txt file reporting the run-time for the problem (all times are in seconds) 

To replicate this result the user should be inside the directory scripts and run the following shell command:

python Cext_wave_dist_prot_sensor_z.py -if full_path_where_input_problem_folder_is_located

In an Nvidia K40c GPU card the run-time is approximately 16 hours.

After running the script the user results can be found in the directory

Cext_variation_with_distance_two_bsa_z_results/
