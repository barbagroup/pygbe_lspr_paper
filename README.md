## Article history

* ArXiv preprint v1 appeared on 12/31/2018.
* Submitted to Comput. Phys. Comm. on 12/31/2018. Desk rejection on 01/14/2019. Editor: "I feel such a (numerical case study is now better placed in a journal of biophysics."
* Second submission to J. Comput. Phys. on 01/20/2019. Desk rejection on 02/02/2019. Editor: "I feel your manuscript is not appropriate for the journal's readership."
Editor offered journal transfer service to ... Comput. Phys. Comm. (!)
Asked EiC to have a second look, giving links to a few papers already published in JCP on the same subject. 
EiC replied that he sent the paper to 3 other executive editors and they all agreed with his original assessment.
* ArXiv preprint v2 appeared on 03/12/2019. Edited for a submission to an APS journal.
* Third submission to _Phys. Rev. E_ on 03/20/2019.
